# üöó Autonomous Driving Object Detection using YOLOv8 and KITTI Dataset

This project applies the YOLOv8 model to detect various objects from autonomous driving scenes using the KITTI dataset. The goal is to train a deep learning model that can recognize vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and more in real-time scenarios.

## üìÅ Dataset

We use the **KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite**, a popular dataset for autonomous driving, containing labeled images for object detection tasks.

### Detected Classes:
- üö∂ Pedestrian
- üö¥ Cyclist
- üöó Car
- üöê Van
- üöõ Truck
- üöã Tram
- üë§ Person Sitting
- ‚ùì Misc
- üö´ DontCare (ignored during training)

## üß† Model

- **Model:** YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once - Version 8)
- **Framework:** Ultralytics YOLOv8
- **Training:** Fine-tuned on the KITTI dataset
- **Input:** RGB images
- **Output:** Bounding boxes with object class and confidence score
